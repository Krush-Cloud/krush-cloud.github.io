After several iterations of going through CD pipelines at work and in my personal projects I feel like I have a very good handle of how different tools try to solve for multiple scenarios.
As a result I have developed my own "style" of GitOps. I believe [https://codefresh.io/](CodeFresh) is probably the closest to what I need, but they are trying to solve a very large set of problems. I just wanted to make my own solution that does one thing really well.
